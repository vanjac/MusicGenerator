# MusicGenerator
This program plays randomly generated music forever.
It uses some simple algorithms I created for generating rhythm, melody, and chord progressions.

music.MusicGUI is the main class.

To start the music, click the 'Start' button.
Adjust the 'Tempo' control to change the tempo of the music,
and the Chord/Melody Instrument controls to change the instruments playing the music
(table [here](https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/gm-level-1-sound-set),
some instruments may not match). Click 'Stop' to stop the music.
